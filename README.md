Make sure you have the requirements installed to be able to run the application locally. First, check if you're running Node version >=`18`. The easiest way to install it is via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Then, go to the app root directory and install the dependencies with pnpm:

```bash
# Step 1: install pnpm if you don't have it already
npm install -g pnpm

# Step 2: install dependencies
pnpm install
```

Then, run the app locally:

```bash
# Step 3: run the app
pnpm dev
```

This starts the development server on port 3000. Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) on your browser to try it out!

## ðŸš€ Tests

To run the tests:

```bash
pnpm test
```
